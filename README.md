🎵 🎶 SurSaar – AI-Powered Real-Time Music School 🎸🎹🥁

SurSaar is a Flutter-powered mobile app that begins as a Bollywood guitar song finder but has a much bigger mission:
👉 To become a real-time AI Music School that listens, watches, and teaches you instruments interactively, starting with guitar.

Whether you’re a beginner learning your first chords or an intermediate musician trying to polish your skills, SurSaar will evolve into your personal music coach — guiding, correcting, and motivating you in real time.

🎯 Main Goal

The ultimate vision of SurSaar is to create a comprehensive AI-driven platform for learning musical instruments, where:

📡 AI listens to your playing (via microphone/audio ML).

👀 AI watches your technique (via camera/computer vision).

🧠 AI analyzes your skill level and identifies mistakes.

🎵 AI teaches you step-by-step with practice routines, feedback, and encouragement.

📊 AI tracks your progress over time like a personal music mentor.


Currently, SurSaar supports guitar-focused features, but the platform is designed to expand into a multi-instrument, real-time music school.
